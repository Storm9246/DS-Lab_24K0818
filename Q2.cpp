// Q2. Create a C++ class named "Exam" using DMA designed to manage student exam records,
// complete with a shallow copy implementation? Define attributes such as student name, exam
// date, and score within the class, and include methods to set these attributes and display exam
// details. As part of this exercise, intentionally omit the implementation of the copy constructor

// Lab Manual 01

// and copy assignment operator. Afterward, create an instance of the "Exam" class, generate a
// shallow copy, and observe any resulting issues?

// ISSUE!!
//   Since we didnâ€™t write our own copy constructor or assignment operator,
//   C++ just copied the memory addresses (shallow copy). That means both objects
//   point to the same name and date. So, when we change one object, the other one
//   also changes. And when the program ends, both objects try to delete the same
//   memory, which can crash the program.
