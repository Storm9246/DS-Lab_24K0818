// Task #3:
// Design a program to handle marks of students in different courses using a jagged array
// (since each student is enrolled in a different number of courses).
// => Input the number of courses each student takes.
// => Dynamically allocate memory for each student accordingly.
// => Calculate and display each studentâ€™s average marks.
